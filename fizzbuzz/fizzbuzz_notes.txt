->FizzBuzz Notes:

1. FizzBuzz with the Print statements
  -Writing a function that prints "fizz" if N is divisible by 3
  -Prints "buzz" if n is divisible by 5
  -Prints "fizzbuzz" if n is divisible by both 3 and 5
  -Lastly prints n if the above condition are are not true

->>>It involves a good practice of the if/else statement along with the % sign 
    which is important for the logic to work in this exercise. I ended up writing three 
    if/else statement, one for the condition that is divisible by 3, by 5 and 3 and 5. Default output which 
    prints n if none of the condition are true. Observation I had from working on this exercise was 
    how I can implement the FizzBuzz function and call it in my main function which was bit challeging 
    but after thinking for a while it clicked and it was pretty easy implementation after that.

2. FizzBuzz using return instead of print statements

->>>The logic was similar to the fizzbuzz with the print statements except this involved using
    return instead of print. It was bit tricky since I had to make the fizzbuzz function a string 
    function and include the string library at the top for the function to return string characters.
    Along with that I had to use a print statement to return the input it used return inside the fizzbuzz
    function.
