Notes on dynamic Array and Deque:

1. Appending to the dynamic array implementation were easy which involved creating an empty array and adding elem_idx to it. The input shows around 10000 rows with 5   columns.

2. Prepending to the dynmaic array was also easy to implement. The showed 3 digit number compare tot he 2 digit number compare to the appending of the array.

3. Appending of deque array showed two digit number similar to the appending of the dynamic array. The results showed 10,000 rows along with 5 colums.

4. Prepending of the deque array showed similar result to the appending of the deque array, I didn't notice any different results expect more three digits numbers.

5. Only thing that I noticed was that how the prepending of the dynamic array was the only array that showed three digit number compare to all the other array in this file.
